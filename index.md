#### 2rd International Workshop on Quality-Aware DevOps (QUDOS 2016)

QUDOS 2016 will be held on July 21, 2016 in Saarbr√ºcken, Germany and will be co-located with the International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis 2016 (ISSTA '16).

DevOps has emerged in recent years as a set of principles and practices for smoothing out the gap between development and operations, thus enabling faster release cycles for complex IT services. Common tools and methods used in DevOps include infrastructure as code, automation through deep modeling of systems, continuous deployment, and continuous integration. As of today, software engineering research has mainly explored these problems from a functional perspective, trying to increase the benefits and generality of these methods for the end users. However, this has left behind the definition of methods and tools for DevOps to assess predict and verify quality dimensions.

The QUDOS workshop focuses on the problem of how to best define and integrate quality assurance methods and tools in DevOps. Quality covers a broadly-defined set of dimensions including performance, reliability, safety, survivability, cost of ownership, among others. To answer this question, the QUDOS workshop wants to bring together experts from academia and industry working in areas such as quality assurance, agile software engineering, and model-based development. The goal is to identify and disseminate novel quality-aware approaches to DevOps.

QUDOS is organized by the consortium of the EU-Project DICE and an international consortium consisting of members from Imperial College London (UK), Politecnico di Milano (Italy), University of Suttgart (Germany) and fortiss GmbH (Germany). QUDOS is technically co-sponsored by the Research Group (RG) of the Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). The QUDOS workshop is an activity of the SPEC RG DevOps Performance Working Group.
